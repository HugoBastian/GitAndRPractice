# Week 2 Overview
## Understanding Bootstraps
1. Created Python script to understand bootstrap sampling distribution with different sample sizes
2. Visualized bootstrap means distribution with histograms and confidence intervals
3. Learned how repeated sampling with replacement generates new combinations of values, affecting mean estimates

## Frequentist vs Bootstrap Analysis
1. Worked with web-browsers dataset to compare frequentist and bootstrap approaches
2. Implemented bootstrap algorithm for mean estimation
3. Visualized bootstrap distribution with histogram and normal curve overlay
4. Extended bootstrap to regression coefficients using a Linear Model; `glm()`

## Multiple Testing
1. Applied Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control false discovery rate
2. Analyzed significance levels with different q-values (0.1, 0.05, 0.01)
3. Created visualization of BH procedure using p-value ranking
4. Tested `fdr_cut()` function on semiconductor dataset
5. Observed how different q-values affect number of significant coefficients
