# Week overview

## Worked on

1. experimented with different modes of *viewing data* using `head()` and `tail()` functions;
2. found that there is a difference between the functions `apply()` and `sapply()` because of how R handles DataFrames. For our context we should use `sapply()`;
3. Covered basic DataFrame operations such as viewing the number of rows and columns;
4. Generated summary statistics and frequency tables for selected columns;
5. Visualized the distribution of certain categorical variables using bar plots;
6. Fitted and summarized a *generalized linear model* (GLM) to examine the influence of various factors (`consultants` and `politicians`) on the probability of strategic meeting outcomes.
7. Expanded the model to include additional independent variables like `journalists`, `unions`, `investors`, and `lawyers`.
