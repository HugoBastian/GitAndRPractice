# Data Science and HR Analytics Practice Repository

This is my practice repository for the course "Data Science and HR Analytics". This repo is organized into weekly folders corresponding to course materials and topics covered.

## Structure

Each weekly folder includes:

- **Practice Files:** Files where I've implemented and modified Dr. Kapoor's R code examples.
- **Learning Notes:** Key takeaways and notes on specific functions or coding techniques.

`Week0` contains files relating to general practice with R, GitHub, and terminal

## Objective

This repository is part of the course evaluation and is intended to show practice and application of concepts learned each week.
